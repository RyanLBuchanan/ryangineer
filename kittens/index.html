  <h1>KittyHub</h1>
  <p id="introP">This website was created for all cat lovers. We want to help you find the most wonderful cat
    you can find. We also would love to make sure that you feed your cat the most wonderful food
    that you can find. We think it is highly important that you understand what kind of breed your
    little Mittens or Leo is indeed.
  </p>
  <p id="secondP">
    Finally, we would really love for you to signup to our website and all of our wonderful and dynamic
    services. We believe that the good cat people should hang together and get together often. We
    should form celebratory and family like groups. As a cat society, we will further the interests of
    all cats. And that means cats all the world over, not just the lovely little ones that we decide to
    rescue and be owned by (because, of course, the true owner is the cat, not the human).
