# Ryangineer

Ryangineer is a porfolio website that I used to reinforce my learning of Machine Learning Algorithms and the mathematics included with each.

 I am very interested the tech industry, preferably with an emphasis on artificial intelligence, such as computer vision, recommender systems, chatbots and/or natural language processing.  I am eager to start out with machine learning & progress to deep learning.  I have also just been accepted to a Data Analytics Masters program.  I have a Masters in Education - Instructional Design & an MBA.  I'd like to combine all of this into a Data Scientist role, eventually.

Also included at this website are links to my Data Dashboard & the Virtual Reality courses I conducted while creating VR Dev Kids LLC.

### Github Project Commit Message format:
> type: Subject . . . .
>
> body
>
> footer

### Commit Message Details:
The subject should be 50 characters or less, with the first letter capitalized, and end without a period. At Udacity, we also include a short annotation about the type of the commit, if it is a bug fix, a feature, change to the documentation, etc.

#### Type:
- feat: a new feature
- fix: a bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
- refactor: refactoring production code
- test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

The body is next, this is where you give a more detailed description of why you made the change. The body should typically have around 72 characters per line. This is to ensure that the message fits into a terminal window when using git on the command line. Youâ€™ll also need to make sure there is a blank line between the subject line and the body. You can also add bullet points, using asterisks or dashes, when you need to make a list.
