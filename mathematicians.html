    <h3><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:P_Aristotle_grey.png" style="color: #A5AFB9;">Aristotle (384-322 B.C.)</a></h3>
    <p>"One of the greatest philosophers in Western culture, was born in Stagira,
      a small town in northern Greece. His father was the personal physician of the
      king of Macedonia. Orphaned young, Aristotle was raised by a guardian.
      <br /> &emsp; At the age of 18, Aristotle entered Plato's academy in Athens. He was the
      'brightest and most learned student' at the Academy which he left when Plato died
      in 347 BC.
      <br /> &emsp; About 342 BC, the king of Macedonia invited him to supervise the
      education of his young son, Alexander, who later became Alexander the Great.
      Aristotle taught him until 336 BC, when the youth became ruler following the
      assassination of his father.
      <br /> &emsp; Around 334 BC, Aristotle return to Athens and
      founded a school called the Lyceum. His philosophy and followers were called
      <i>peripatetic</i>, a Greek word meaning 'walking around,' since Aristotle taught his
      students while walking with them. The Athenians, perhaps resenting his
      relationship with Alexander the Great, who had conquered them accused him of impiety soon
      after the Emperor's death in 323 BC. Aristotle, knowing the fate of Socrates,
      who had been condemned to death on a similar charge, fled to Chalcis, so the
      Athenians would not 'sin twice against philosophy.' He died there the following year."

    <p>"The son of a cobbler whose main interests were mathematics & the making
      of optical instruments, was born in Lincoln, England. Beyond attending a local
      elementary school and briefly a commercial school, Boole was self-taught in
      mathematics and the classics. When his father's business failed, he started
      working to support the family. At 16, he began his teaching career, opening
      a school of his own four years later in Lincoln.
      <br /> &emsp; In his leisure time, Boole read mathematical journals at the Mechanics
      Institute. There he grappled with the works of English physicist and mathematician
      Sir Isaac Newton and French mathematicians Pierre-Simon Laplace and Joseph-Louis
      Lagrange.
      <br /> &emsp; In 1839, Boole begin contributing original papers on differential equations
      to <i>The Cambridge Mathematics Journal</i> & on analysis to the Royal Society. In
      1844, he was awarded a Royal Medal by the Society for his contributions to
      analysis; he was elected a fellow of the Society in 1857.
      <br /> &emsp; Developing novel ideas in logic and symbolic reasoning, he published
      his first contribution to symbolic logic, <i>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic</i>,
      in 1847. His publications played a key role in his appointment as professor
      of mathematics at Queens College, Cork, Ireland, in 1849, although he lacked
      the university education.
      <br /> &emsp; In 1854, he published his most important work,
      <i>An Investigation to the Laws of Thought</i>, and he presented the algebra
      of logic now known as boolean algebra. The next year he married Mary Everest,
      the niece of Sir George Everest, for whom the mountain is named.
      <br /> &emsp; In addition to writing about 50 papers, Boole published two textbooks,
      <i>Treatise on Differential Equations (1859)</i> &
      <i>Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences</i>; both were used as texts
      in the United Kingdom for many years.
      <br /> &emsp; A conscientious & devoted teacher, Boole died of pneumonia in Cork."

    <h3><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="" style="color: #A5AFB9;">Georg Cantor (1845-1918)</a></h3>
    <p>"Was born in St Petersburg Russia where his father was a successful merchant
      and broker. Cantor showed great interest in mathematics from early childhood.
      In 1856 the family moved to Germany. Six years later, he entered the
      University of Zurich, but in the following year he moved to the University
      of Halle to study mathematics, physics, and philosophy. There he was greatly
      influenced by the eminent mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897). Although
      his father wanted him to become an engineer, Cantor relentlessly pursued his
      interest in mathematics and received his doctorate of philosophy at 22 from
      the University of Berlin for his Works in number theory.
      <br /> &emsp; In 1869, Cantor began his professional career as an unsalaried
      lecturer at the University of Halle. Five years later, he published his
      revolutionary work on set theory. Cantor developed an arithmetic of
      transfinite numbers analogous to that of finite numbers, thus creating
      another area of mathematical study. He proved that the set of real numbers
      is uncountable & he also established the existence of infinitely many
      ordinal numbers by ingenious methods. He also made significant contributions
      to indent equations in trigonometric series. Deeply religious, Cantor was
      also interested in art, music, and philosophy.
      <br /> &emsp; Being unhappy with his low salary at the university, Cantor
      tried to secure a better paid position at the University of Berlin, but was
      sabotaged by Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891), an eminent mathematician at the
      University, who severely criticized Cantor views on sets.
      <br /> &emsp; Relentless attacks by contemporary mathematicians intensified
      the manic depression he suffered from. Cantor died in a mental hospital in
      Halle in 1918.
      <br /> &emsp; Cantor was 'one of the greatest intellects of the 19th century,'
      according to Bertrand Russell. He 'was an imaginative geniuses work has
      inspired [every aspects of] mathematical thought,' Hazel Perfect of the
      University of Sheffield wrote in 1994."

    <p>"Born in Mandurai, Tamil Nadu, India where his father was a colonel in the
      Indian army. When the young De Morgan was 7 months old, the family moved to
      England. He attended a private schools, where he mastered Latin, Greek and
      Hebrew and developed a strong interest in mathematics. After graduating in
      1827 from Trinity College, Cambridge, he pondered a career either in medicine
      or law, but pursued mathematics. His professional career began in 1828 at
      University College, London. Three years later, however, when the college
      dismissed a colleague in anatomy without explanation, De Morgan resigned
      on principle. He returned to Trinity in 1836 when his successor died and
      remained there until a second resignation in 1866.
      <br /> &emsp; A fellow of the Astronomical Society and a founder of the London
      Mathematics Society, De Morgan greatly influenced the development of mathematics
      in the 19th century. He exuded his passion for the subject in his teaching,
      stressing principles over techniques.
      <br /> &emsp; An incredible prolific writer, De Morgan authored more than
      1,000 articles in more than 15 journals, as well as a number of textbooks,
      all characterized by clarity, logical presentation and meticulous detail.
      <br /> &emsp; De Morgan's original contributions to mathematics were mainly
      in analysis and logic. In 1838, he had been he coined the term "mathematical
      induction" and gave a clear justification to this proof method, although it
      had been in use. His the <i>Differential and Integral Calculus</i> (1848)
      gives the first precise definition of a limit and some tests for convergence
      of infinite series.
      <br /> &emsp; De Morgan was also interested in the history of mathematics.
      He wrote biographies of Sir Isaac Newton and Edmund Halley. His wife wrote
      De Morgan's biography in 1882.
      <br /> &emsp; His researches into all branches of knowledge and his prolific
      writing left him little time for social or family life, but he was well-known
      for his sense of humor."

    <h3><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aldoaldoz/4815419108" style="color: #A5AFB9;">Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872-1970)</a></h3>
    <p>"A British philosopher and mathematician, was born into a prominent,
      aristocratic and progressive-minded family near Trelleck, Wales. His mother
      died in 1874 and his father 2 years later; so the young Russell was brought
      up by his father's parents.
      <br /> &emsp; Russell was home educated by tutors. In 1890 he
      entered Trinity College, cambridge, where he excelled in both mathematics
      and moral sciences. In 1895, he was awarded a fellowship for his original
      dissertation on the foundations of geometry, published in 1897. After
      graduation, he worked briefly in the British Embassy in Paris and then he
      went to Germany, where he wrote his first book, <i>German Social Democracy</i>
      (1896). In 1910, Trinity appointed him a lecturer and logic and the
      philosophy of mathematics.
      <br /> &emsp; Russell's outspokenness and liberal views often landed him
      in controversies. Around 1907, Russell fought hard for women's suffrage in
      the United Kingdom. During World War I, he was dismissed by Trinity for
      his protests in pacifist views. In 1918, he was in prison for 6 months for
      an article that was branded sedicious. While in prison, he wrote
      <i>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</i>. When he was about 90 years
      old, he was imprisoned again for campaigning for nuclear disarmament.
      <br /> & emsp; In 1925, Trinity, realizing that the 1916 dismissal was
      excessively harsh, invited Russell back. He served there as a fellow from
      1944 until his death.
      <br /> &emsp; Russell wrote more than 40 books on diverse subjects,
      including philosophy and physics; his greatest work is the three volume
      <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (1910-1913), which he co-authored with the
      Cambridge philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947). It describes the
      logical constructions of the foundations of mathematics from the set of
      primitive axioms.
      <br /> &emsp; Russell won the 1950 Nobel Prize for literature "'as a
      defender of humanity and freedom of thought.'"

      to Moscow to tutor Tsarevich Peter II and his cousin Anna of Courland.
      From 1729 to 1763, he corresponded with Euler on number theory. He
      returned to the Imperial Academy in 1732, when Peter's successor Anna
      moved the Imperial Court to St Petersburg.
      <br /> &emsp; In 1742, Goldbach joined the Russian Ministry of Foreign
      Affairs, and later became privy councilor and established guidelines for
      the education of royal children.
      <br /> &emsp; Noted for his conjectures and number theory and work in analysis, gold buck died in moscow.

    <h3><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://picryl.com/media/leibniz-gottfried-wilhelm-freiherr-von-48c220" style="color: #A5AFB9;">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)</a></h3>
    <p>"An outstanding German mathematician, philosopher, physicist, diplomat
      and linguist, was born into a Lutheran family. The son of a professor of
      philosophy, he 'grew up to be a genius with encyclopedic knowledge.'
      <br /> &emsp; He had taught himself latin, Greek and philosophy before entering
      University at Leipzig at age 15 as a law student. There he read The Works
      of great scientists and philosophers such as Galileo, Francis Bacon, and
      Rene Descartes. Because of his youth, Leipzig refused to award him the
      degree of doctor of laws, so he left his native City forever.
      <br /> &emsp; During 1663 to 1666, he attended the universities of Jena and Altdorf,
      and receiving his doctorate from the latter in 1666, he began legal services
      for the electorate of Mainz. After the elector's death, Liebniz pursued
      scientific studies. In 1672, he built the calculating machine that could
      multiply and divide and presented it to the Royal Society in London the
      following year.
      <br /> &emsp; In late 1675, Leibniz laid the foundations of calculus, an honor he
      shares with Sir Isaac newton. He discovered the fundamental theorem of calculus,
      and invented the popular notations d/dx for differentiation and &#8747; for
      integration. He also introduced such modern notations such as dot for
      multiplication, the decimal point, the equal sign, and the colon for ratio.
      <br /> &emsp; From 1676, until his death, Leibniz worked for the Duke of Brunswick
      at Hanover and his estate after the Duke's death in 1680. He played a key
      role in the founding of the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1700.
      <br /> &emsp; Twelve years later, Leibniz was appointed councilor of the Russian
      Empire and was given the title baron by Peter the Great.
      <br /> &emsp; Suffering greatly from gout, Leibniz died in Hanover. He was never married.
      <br /> &emsp; His Works influenced such diverse disciplines as theology, philosophy,
      mathematics, the natural sciences, history and technology."
